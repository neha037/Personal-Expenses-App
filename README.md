Concepts Used-

    Flutter Fundamentals-
        ● Compose UI from built-in and custom Widgets
        ● Styling and configuration via arguments
        ● Custom Widgets composing other built-in and custom Widgets.

    Theming
        ● Defining Global Theme for colour and text to use is anywhere in the app via Theme.of(context)
        ● Built-in Widgets use Theme setting automatically

    Styling and Configuring Widgets
        ● Styling and Layout options such as EdgeInsets.all(), BoxDecoration(), enums.. e.t.c.
        ● More them one Widget to get the things done.
        ● Importing external Packages to add custom premade widgets to the application

    Business Logic
        ● Lift state up and use stateful Widgets only when needed
        ● Pass functions references and data around.
